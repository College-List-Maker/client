                "Collegy is a platform that helps high school students find their perfect college match. It was created by college students who wanted to make the process of finding a college easier and more efficient. The platform uses an algorithm that sources data from open source databases to provide a list of colleges that are most suitable for each individual student.",
                "One of the key features of Collegy is its ability to take into account a student's specific interests and goals. The algorithm looks at factors such as a student's academic record, extracurricular activities, and career aspirations in order to identify colleges that are likely to be the best fit. This means that students can find colleges that offer the programs and opportunities that are most relevant to their interests, rather than having to sift through a long list of colleges that may not be as well-suited to their needs.",
                "Overall, Collegy is a valuable resource for high school students who are trying to navigate the often overwhelming process of finding the right college. By using the platform's sophisticated algorithm, students can quickly and easily find colleges that are most likely to help them achieve their academic and professional goals.",
